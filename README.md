# Some Interesting C code

Here are some interesting C codes that I wrote. Among them are:

- `Calendar` :This is a small program that can generate a perpetual calendar, you only need to enter the year, and you will be able to generate a txt file, which is the calendar of that year.

- `factorial` :This is a small program that can generate a perpetual calendar, you only need to enter the year, and you will be able to generate a txt file, which is the calendar of that year.

- `Card games`ï¼šz This is a card game where customers can think of a number in their minds and look for it in the cards and tell the host the card that contains the number. The host can use these cards to get the number in the customer's mind. This program generates these cards.

All this seems so delightful,aren't they? Hope they can heelp you.
